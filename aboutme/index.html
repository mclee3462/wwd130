    <h2>Michael Lee</h2>
    <h2>Nickname: Mike</h2>
    <p>I am heading into computer science and hoping to be able to go into cyber scurity once it opens.</p>
    <p>I like playing card, board, or video games. </p>
    <p>I am currently working at a monitoring center for those with life alert systems/ security systems. I will be changing jobs with my career to better serve those who seek better data protection and want to enjoy privacy while they are on the internet.</p>
    <p>I love the amount you can grow up here at BYUI. I am currently pursuing a computer science degree but I will switch to a cyber security degree once it is availible up here.</p>
